Jellynote frontend code challenge

For convenience, this project was made using Vue-Cli. To run this exercise, first you need to clone the project.
Once you have the project in your local machine you need to ```cd``` to your local project folder and run two commands:

First you install dependencies by running

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

and then you run serve to compile code for development

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

Other commands unnecessary for this exercise include:

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
