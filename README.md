This is a small frontend code challenge made public. Simple integration of infinite loading, lazy-loading and [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) interaction.

For convenience, this small project was made using Vue-Cli. To run this exercise, first you need to clone the project.
Once you have the project in your local machine you need to ```cd``` to your local project folder and run two commands:
